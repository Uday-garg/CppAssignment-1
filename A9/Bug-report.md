# Bug 1

1. **The incorrect original code or code snippit that you wrote:**

``` cpp
 StockPrices s(*ptr, *max);
    cout << s.avg();
```

2. **What bug does the original code have?**
    
    I used pointers for ptr and max     
  

3. **What misunderstanding of C++ concepts lead you to this incorrect code?**
   
    I thought that pointers would be a good idea as they point to the memory location
4. **How to correct the bug?**
    
    Just remove the pointers
5. **The corresponding bug-free code or code snippet is:**

```
 StockPrices s(ptr, max);
    cout << s.avg();
```

6. **What is the take-away message from this bug?**
   
   I should always debug my code
